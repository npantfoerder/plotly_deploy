# Plotly & Navel Biodiversity

## Purpose
Roza, a biological researcher in a micoobiology laboratory, is interested in bacteria that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. She has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify various bacterial species. She needs help creating a dashboard that both her research participants, and fellow researchers can access. Using HTML to build the webpage, and JavaScript to read the data and create visualizations through Plotly, the finished product will include the following:
- A jumbotron header
- A dropdown menu where you can select the subject id 
- Demographic information about the selected participant
- Bar chart of the top ten bacterial species found
- Gauge chart for the washing frequency
- Bubble chart of all samples found
